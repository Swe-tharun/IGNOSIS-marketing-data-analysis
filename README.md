🫂**Hypothesis Based on Customer Loyalty and Product Preferences**🫂 

From the data, we observe that the top three most profitable products are snack items, 
specifically Dorito Corn Chips and Smiths Crinkle Chips in various flavors. This indicates 
that high sales volume and profitability come from popular, frequently consumed snack 
products. 
Characteristics of Loyal Customers: 

• Most loyal customers belong to Older Families and Young Families, suggesting that 
family-oriented buyers are a key segment. 

• A significant number of them are in the Budget category, implying that affordability 
plays a role in retention. 

• Mainstream and Premium customers also contribute to loyalty, indicating a mix of 
price-sensitive and quality-conscious buyers. 


🙌🙌**My   Hypothesis on Customer Loyalty:** 🙌🙌

Loyal customers prefer familiar, widely available snack brands that cater to family 
consumption. Older and young families likely buy these products for household snacking or 
gatherings, reinforcing their loyalty to brands offering affordable, well-known, and 
frequently discounted snacks.
